# Game-Engine
**A game engine written in C/C++ using OpenGL and GFLW.**

### What is this?
This engine is a lightweight game engine that could be used to create simple games, or other OpenGL applications.

It's currently incomplete, there are many features that I would like to implement later on.

This engine is just a hobby of mine, so there's no real time goal for me to finish this, but it's a big culmination of everything I've done.

### Current Features
- Basic object tree structure
- Automatic memory management on objects
- Render loop
- Window creation
- Basic mouse and keyboard input

### Roadmap
- Mesh components
- Skyboxes
- Automatic texture and other resource management
- DirectInput / XInput support
- Audio support of some kind (XAudio?)
- Networking of some kind
- Isolate the OpenGL renderer
  - Implement DirectX or Vulkan later on
- Add Mac OS or Linux support
- Load and save scenes for later use
